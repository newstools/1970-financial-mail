Despite a slew of recommendations, I ve been late to get in on Chef s Table, already in its third season.The Easter weekend provided some much-needed downtime and I finally got stuck into this Netflix documentary.It s brilliantly curated. It goes inside the lives and kitchens of the world s most renowned chefs and leaves you: a) rather hungry; b) with a deep appreciation for ingredients and the craft of food; and c) inspired by their talent and passion.If you re a foodie, you ll recognise some of the big names, such as Nancy Silverton and Massimo Bottura, and be inclined to start there. Don t. Start with the lesser-knowns; they will wow you.
