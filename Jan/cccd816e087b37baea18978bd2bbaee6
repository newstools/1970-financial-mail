Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has directed the Eskom board to rescind its decision to reinstate Brian Molefe as group CE of Eskom.This was on the basis of a decision of the interministerial committee, which was set up by President Jacob Zuma to investigate the reinstatement.Following the decision, Brown met the Eskom board on Wednesday to direct it to remove Molefe.She said at a media briefing on Wednesday that she had also instructed the board to give her at least two two names from the current Eskom executive so she could appoint an acting group CE.Brown said she would appoint an acting CE within the next 48 hours to ensure continuity. Furthermore, she would have the opportunity to rotate the board after the Eskom AGM on June 23.Justice Minister Michael Masutha, the convener of the interministerial committee, announced the committee's decision at the media briefing, which was also attended by the other committee members - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and Energy Minister Mmamaloko Kubayi.Masutha said the decision was in the best interests of Eskom, government and the country as a whole.The committee was set up by Zuma in the wake of several court applications in the Gauteng High Court by the DA, EFF and Solidarity to have the reappointment of Molefe set aside as null and void.In replying affidavits, Eskom has conceded that mistakes were made in dealing with Molefe's departure and reinstatement.It was a mistake, for example, that the 50-year-old Molefe could take early retirement in November 2016 before the required age of 55 years. This was in contravention of the Eskom pension fund rules."In its affidavit Eskom makes major concessions," Masutha noted.The decision to rescind the early retirement prior to Molefe's reinstatement was also a mistake. These mistakes could have been corrected administratively without requiring Molefe's reinstatement, Masutha said.The interministerial committee decided the new contract of reinstatement for Molefe was drawn up under the 2016 memorandum of incorporation, without the minister being party to it as was required.Brown said there were many complex issues that had to be worked through by the interministerial committee.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said the committee believed that the decision to reinstate Molefe should not have been taken. "It has caused government a lot of harm and a lot of reputational damage. It has caused Eskom itself a lot of reputational damage."The issues of governance at state-owned enterprises were critical, Gigaba said, adding that the decision of the interministerial committee Eskom demonstrated that government as shareholder could self-correct where wrong decisions had been taken.
