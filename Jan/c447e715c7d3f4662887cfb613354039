He s the bad boy of food TV (or certainly thinks he is) and he gets to travel the world and eat professionally. We d hate Anthony Bourdain if he weren t so utterly charming and interesting.If you haven t seen any of his numerous food series, now is the time to binge watch them on Netflix.There are three (The Layover, A Cook s Tour and No Reservations) on the streaming service, so you can get lost in a world of him exploring everywhere from Austin, Texas to Kurdistan and Ukraine.Though each series has a marginally different hook, you can always expect him to devour both delicious and weird things in equal measure, talk to fascinating people and drink a lot.
