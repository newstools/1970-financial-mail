I am currently hooked on this nerdy but relatable podcast from the US&#8217;s National Public Radio.In its own words, Hidden Brain &quot;reveals the unconscious patterns that drive human behaviour, the biases that shape our choices, and the triggers that direct the course of our relationships&quot;.It&#8217;s basically about why we do what we do.Host and longtime science journalist Shankar Vedantam breaks down complex scientific ideas into understandable tidbits.You can start at #67 (titled The Hole), where he takes a look at the reality of solitary confinement at prisons across the US, as well as the psychological effects of being alone for long periods of time.Oh, and #64, titled I&#8217;m Right, You&#8217;re Wrong, is pretty good too. You know how there are topics for which no amount of data will change people&#8217;s minds? Vedantam delves into why we tend to stick to our beliefs and disregard any new information that contradicts them.
