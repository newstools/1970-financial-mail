Standard Bank Young Artist for 2017 Beth Diane Armstrong opens her sculptural exhibition in Johannesburg this week in its first showing since the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown last month.Armstrong is one of SA&#8217;s leading contemporary sculptors of her generation, and the exhibition, In perpetuum, captures her mastery of mediums such as steel.The exhibition is especially striking in that it captures Armstrong&#8217;s ability to switch effortlessly between intricate smaller works and imposing, large-scale masses of steel.In perpetuum encompasses themes and motifs drawn from Armstrong&#8217;s entire career as a sculptor, with some critics saying that it marks a full-circle return to the period when she received her master&#8217;s degree in fine art from Rhodes University in 2010.&#8226; The exhibition will run at Johannesburg&#8217;s Standard Bank Gallery from August 4 to September 30.
