&nbsp;New video streaming service Digital Entertainment on Demand (DEOD) has launched in SA, bringing more competition to Netflix and Showmax.Local digital media company Discover Digital unveiled the video-on-demand entertainment player last month.Its offering includes a mix of new-release movies including Rogue One and Moana that are available to rent for R18-R30 a movie, as well as on-demand older titles, documentaries, children s programmes, series, and, finally, a handful of Internet TV channels.The latter includes news channels such as BBC World, Al Jazeera, Bloomberg television, and RT, and a small selection of sports channels. It s this that DEOD is selling as its major point of differentiation.For now, there are five sports channels with a focus on niche or less mainstream sports: EdgeSport HD, FightBox HD, Motorvision, Nautical Channel and education channel Sportskool, each with associated TV guides for download.What you won t find is live streaming of whole mainstream sports matches, so it isn t a direct competitor to DStv s sports channels. However, DEOD does offer short highlights videos of such matches under the "DEOD Sports Network" (DSN) label.At the time of review there were more than 100 DSN options listed, such as "Soccer Europa Reaction" and "Rugby British and Irish Lions Preview". These are not channels, but daily highlights usually a couple of minutes in length available across a wide variety of sports.The on-demand content includes series such as Mad Men, Suits, Weeds and The L Word, and classic films such as Gorillas in the Mist, The Green Mile and The English Patient. New movie titles are available for rent.DEOD offers subscription packages starting from R49, and you can unsubscribe at any point, so you are not tied into a long contract. The Premium option costs R189 and includes a combination of news, sport and on-demand content.You can access DEOD with iOS and Android apps, and using a browser on your PC. Chromecast and AirPlay (Apple) options will be available on "bespoke Internet media player devices and via a Smart TV app in 2017". The company offers "dual view" capability, and allows five linked devices on a single account.DEOD video streamingCool factor ****Usability ****Value for money ****
