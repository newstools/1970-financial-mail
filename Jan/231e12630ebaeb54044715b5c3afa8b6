A new ballet that draws on three dance companies as well as the skills of top stage director Fiona Ramsay will premiere in Johannesburg next Friday.Ramsay has been working with Joburg Ballet, the Vuyani Dance Theatre (VDT) and Moving Into Dance Mophatong (MIDM) on the production of Big City, Big Dreams which will run at the Joburg Theatre.Adding to the mix are choreographers Shannon Glover (Joburg Ballet), Lulu Mlangeni (VDT) and Sunnyboy Motau (MIDM), who have put together a ballet that tells the story of a young man who steps onto the corporate ladder, only to discover an unexpected and fascinating window to the world of dance opening before him.Big City, Big Dreams fuses styles from classical ballet and contemporary and street dance, and is set to an original score by composer Nik Sakellarides.There are just eight performances.
