At last! Business Leadership SA, under doughty chairman Jabu Mabuza, has added its considerable corporate citizen s voice to the outcry against the hijacking of government by President Jacob Zuma and his Gupta family cronies. The organisation ran advertisements in the Sunday newspapers urging ANC members and MPs to "exercise their conscience in taking whatever immediate steps are needed to reverse corruption and state capture, and to restore confidence" in the leadership, economy and future of SA.Not all publicity is necessarily good publicity, as UK-based Bell Pottinger has no doubt discovered. The public relations company has taken the unusual step of firing a client, the Gupta-linked Oakbay Investments in SA. But this has not stopped a campaign to name and shame Bell Pottinger executives symbolised by Victoria Geoghegan, its MD for financial &amp; corporate practice who are accused of sowing racial division, hate speech and fake news in SA on behalf of the controversial Gupta family.
