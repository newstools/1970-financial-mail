We analyse Costa Economou, CEO of Colourfield.If someone came to you tomorrow with R100m to invest in just one company, which would it be?Without knowing what proportion of the individual s wealth the R100m constitutes, or what his or her financial objectives are, it is impossible to make any investment recommendations. I would invite the individual&nbsp;in for a cup of coffee and take it&nbsp;from there.Which talent would you most like to have?The ability to sing. While I have been known for my moonwalk and other breakdance-like moves, I have a terrible voice.What was your first job?I worked for my parents in their "fish-and-chips" shop.

I did this from the age of seven.What s your biggest regret?Not winning last month s Colourfield table tennis final by a bigger margin.Your worst investment mistake?Investing in a friend s supermarket.What s the best investment you ve ever made?Investing in my education.Apple or Samsung?Apple.

My current favourite is Pharrell Williams s "Doowit", from the movie Despicable Me 3.
