Neil Sonnekus&#8217;s debut novel, Son, has just been released, and it is already being hailed as a classic post-apartheid read.Though funny at times, the book is also achingly poignant and deeply moving. It captures what it means to be a white man in SA, confronting a rapid loss of power while struggling to come to terms with stark sociopolitical change.Sonnekus&#8217;s main character is recent divorc&#233; Len Bezuidenhout, whose quest for sex makes for some of the funniest reading, while his relationship with his puritanical old father is pretty gritty.Son is a profound journey of compassion and self-understanding, and though it is dark in parts, it carries the colours of a rainbow nation.
