Investors with long memories will recall that back in the early 2000s, when the rest of the mining sector was gearing up to take advantage of the surge in prices caused by China&rsquo;s rapid industrialisation, Anglo American management was cutting back and selling off its assets.By the time the board was confident the recovery was sustainable and started to look around for acquisitions, asset prices were expensive and the costs of developing new mines had soared.As a result, the group underperformed the upturn.Again, as the Investec &ldquo;mining clock&rdquo;, which tracks typical cyclical developments, shows the industry at the beginning of another upturn, Anglo American is continuing to defer dividends and capital spending while other mining companies are showing signs of greater optimism.BHP Billiton declared an interim dividend of US40c/share, including an extra US10c above the minimum policy distribution. It plans to spend $5.6bn on capital and exploration this year, rising to $6.3bn next year.Even in the gold sector, where price gains have not kept up with bulk commodities, Gold Fields, DRDGold and AngloGold Ashanti have paid dividends. Gold Fields and DRDGold are continuing to spend money on future growth projects.Commodity prices may justify Anglo&rsquo;s caution, but its financial position is improving.The group&rsquo;s platinum and diamond assets continued to suffer from weak prices, offsetting stronger iron ore and metallurgical coal. Overall, the group&rsquo;s average prices in dollars fell 3%, offset partly by weaker currencies in the main countries in which it operates. Profits were boosted by growth in volumes and reduced costs. Attributable free cash flow was $2.6bn compared with a negative $982m in 2015.Anglo American CEO Mark Cutifani says the intention is to resume a dividend at the end of this year after making further improvements in debt and the cost base. When the dividend is resumed, it will be about 30%-40% of earnings, but the final decision depends on the board.All the Anglo subsidiary companies followed the same policy of withholding dividends, even Kumba Iron Ore, whose share price plunged in response.Shoaib Vayej, a portfolio manager at Afena Capital, says the big recent price gains have been in bulk commodities like iron ore, metallurgical coal, manganese and chrome ore but many market analysts doubt whether these gains are sustainable.The big diversified groups that are able to return capital to shareholders at this point&nbsp;are those with the strongest balance sheets, Vayej says.Anglo American is less able than its peers to do so. It has more debt and has been less successful in making disposals than other groups. Conserving cash to repay debt enhances equity value anyway, so shareholders still benefit.Vayej believes Anglo is wise to prioritise debt repayments over dividends, particularly since it was feared it might have to hold a rights issue to appease debt holders.Cutifani says there are no plans to make further asset sales to reduce debt.Three years ago the strategy was to dispose of assets other than diamonds, platinum and copper to cut debt from $13bn to below $10bn by the end of last year. Net debt was $8.5bn by end-December and the target is to reduce it to below $7bn by the end of this year and recover the group&rsquo;s investment-grade credit rating.Apart from a couple of fairly substantial sales such as Angloplat&rsquo;s Rustenburg operations to Sibanye Gold and the Anglo group&rsquo;s niobium and phosphate business in Brazil to China Molybdenum, other disposals were modest.Anglo has not succeeded in selling either Kumba or its SA coal mines supplying Eskom. Kumba shares could have been unbundled to Anglo shareholders, though that would not have raised funds for Anglo. But the attempt to exit these assets was fraught with political overtones, as government demanded these assets be put together to create an &ldquo;SA mining champion&rdquo;.Cutifani says Anglo has undertaken major restructuring of its SA assets and it does not intend to exit the country. SA remains a good jurisdiction, though Anglo would like to see more certainty on policy to ensure it can invest with confidence. It was comfortable to retain its export thermal coal mines and Kumba.Its three domestic coal mines and the New Largo project to supply Kusile power station do not meet Eskom&rsquo;s requirement of being 50% plus one share black owned but at that level they would not meet Anglo&rsquo;s ownership requirements either. Anglo is continuing to hold discussions with Eskom, Cutifani says, and an announcement is likely to be made within the next two to three months.Anglo&rsquo;s 40% share in the Samancor manganese joint venture with South32, which is managed by South32, was widely expected to be sold. Cutifani says Anglo is &ldquo;open to conversations&rdquo; about it but is not in a formal sale process.He says there is no fundamental change in Anglo&rsquo;s stated strategy of focusing on three core commodities: platinum, copper and diamonds. Anglo does not believe the recent gains in iron ore and metallurgical coal prices will continue in the long term and it does not have the same weight in iron ore and coal as its competitors. These assets will remain in the bulk commodities division and work on improving their performance will continue, while Anglo will focus on its core portfolio.Though the Anglo companies have continued to invest money in existing operations, called stay in business capital, growth capital remains severely constrained, raising questions about the longer-term future of these operations.For the group, capex was cut to $2.5bn last year from $4bn in 2015 and a similar sum will be spent this year as the Minas-Rio iron ore, Gahcho Ku diamond and Grosvenor coal projects have started production. Cutifani says the group is producing more commodities from fewer assets. We are a larger organisation with a smaller cost base, he says.Kumba slashed capex by 65% to R2.4bn and will spend R2.6bn-R2.8bn this year, mainly on the relocation of the Dingleton village, and R3.5bn-R3.7bn in 2018. From 2020 to 2022 capex will rise as Kolomela will open a new pit.CEO Themba Mkhwanazi says there are various projects in the medium term designed to deliver incremental growth at low capital cost and with short paybacks.Angloplat cut capex 9% to R3.4bn and expects to spend R3.7bn-R4.2bn this year.CFO Ian Botha says no new projects were advanced last year and, like Kumba, Angloplat s capex will be directed to relatively inexpensive, fast payback and value-accretive projects.Angloplat is continuing studies into extensions in the medium term at Mogalakwena, Der Brochen, Unki and Amandelbult, with the first three receiving priority. CEO Chris Griffith says longer-term growth in output will be considered only if the market needs the metal and the group s balance sheet allows for it.The industry s ratio of capex to depreciation is at particularly low levels, showing companies have been spending too little on capital projects, Vayej says, but this is understandable.When the outlook is negative for particular commodities and it is impossible to grow without flooding the market, it makes sense to wind operations down and return cash to shareholders instead.High depreciation rates are often a reflection of poor historical capital allocation, which could rebase through impairments, he says.Anglo s shares, which initially firmed in response to its financial results, rapidly gave up their gains and at R220 are close to their levels of two years ago, before the plunge in commodities prices between late 2015 and early 2016. On a long-term view, the shares are at similar levels to October 2008.Investec s mining team says the decision to pass the dividend was not a surprise since management s target is to reduce debt. Investec believes the target of bringing debt below $7bn by year-end is achievable.Vayej says Glencore is the best positioned of the diversified commodities groups because it can resume stalled output at low capital cost and its marketing business is less cyclical and less capital intensive than its mining activities.
