It thinks it can tow an iceberg 9,000km from Antarctica to its coast, a process it expects to take an entire year.

Policing Japan s streetsA single murder by gunshot was recorded for the whole of 2015 in Japan, where crime rates have been falling for 13 years. Surprisingly, the size of the country s police force has swelled. The Economist says beat cops, known colloquially as omawari-san (Mr Walk-around), are a fixture in neighbourhoods. Japan has 259,000 officers 15,000 more than a decade ago. Tokyo also has the world s biggest police force a quarter bigger than the one protecting New York. But the force is surprisingly inefficient, solving less than 30% of reported crimes.3. Help from TinderThe last surviving male white northern rhino has an outside chance of finding a suitable mate.
