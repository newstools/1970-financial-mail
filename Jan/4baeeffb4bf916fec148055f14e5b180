South Africans turned up in their thousands to demand that President Jacob Zuma step down. The protests, in response to SA s ratings downgrade prompted by Zuma s cabinet purge and ANC capture, went off much better than expected and have gathered steam. "I m very proud of the way South Africans responded, putting their differences aside and coming together as a true rainbow nation," said Sipho Pityana, leader of Save SA, which organised the demos along with the Black Sash and others.Anglo American Platinum chairman Mohammed Valli Moosa, former struggle activist and ANC minister-turned-businessman, had to admit he should have mentioned (in his chairman s letter) the sudden spike in deaths to seven at the world s biggest platinum miner last year, from two the year before.Moosa, who flies under the radar these days, came in for a polite roasting over the omission from corporate activist Theo Botha at Friday s AGM, where calls for leadership accountability echoed those on the streets.
