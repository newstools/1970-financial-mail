In his final press conference as finance minister, Pravin Gordhan lambasted the shoddy "intelligence report" apparently used as a pretext by President Jacob Zuma for firing him.Speaking at treasury, Gordhan held up a print-out of the report and described it as "absolute nonsense".This accords with the views of others who have weighed in on the issue in the last few days. Notably, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the dubious report carried a number of "unsubstantiated allegations".Ramaphosa said it was "totally, totally unacceptable" for Zuma to fire his finance minister, based on such a flimsy report. "My strong objection (is) to the removal of minister of finance and his deputy based on spurious allegations".Not only is this the strongest statement yet by the deputy president on the actions of his immediate superior, it is also the first on-the-record confirmation that this report was raised by Zuma as one of the reasons why he wanted to axe Gordhan in a meeting with senior ANC leaders.The report, contained below, is littered with spelling and grammatical errors, leaps of logic and irrational statements. While Gordhan may now be out of the treasury, the deeper concern is that the country is still headed by a president who places faith in reports that many others immediately flag as of dubious value.
