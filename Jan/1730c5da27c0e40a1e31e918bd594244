To say the past five months have been a chaotic time for the SA construction industry would be an understatement.Seven listed construction and engineering groups that were found to have colluded around the 2010 Fifa World Cup Stadium projects have been made to contribute R1.5bn over 12 years to promote black ownership in the sector as part of a settlement with government.Parties to the (voluntary) settlement are Murray &amp; Roberts, Aveng, WBHO, Stefanutti Stocks, Raubex, Basil Read and Group Five.For this to happen they had to cough up about R170m each in upfront payments, according to financial accounting regulations. This is over and above the R1.46bn competition commission fine imposed earlier on 15 construction companies for alleged collusive practices.Obviously, this has negatively affected profits &mdash; and at the worst possible time. Many of the companies are struggling in dismal construction and engineering markets.Judging by the faces of ministers and industry executives at key moments during the process, it also seems voluntarism has been accompanied by significant arm-twisting.But the settlement has resulted in multimillion-rand claims by the SA National Roads Agency evaporating, though some companies are still liable for civil claims by the City of Cape Town, and possibly other entities.There is little doubt, though, that the agreement is a good thing.Black construction groups will now get a crack at big infrastructure projects, and relations between the industry and government have been vastly improved, say participants.However, government needs to start spending on big projects quickly to retain and foster skills, while meeting the country&rsquo;s needs &mdash; especially in municipal water, sanitation and port and rail infrastructure.Consulting Engineers SA says of 533 companies on its database, only 122 are black owned. The industry body says small, medium and micro enterprises make up about 95% of its membership.Of these, only 24% are black owned.However, the fallout from the voluntary settlement agreement has been diverse &mdash; not least when it comes to Murray &amp; Roberts.The group has exited building and infrastructure markets in SA to pursue more global ambitions in underground mining, oil and gas, and power and water projects.A consortium led by the Southern Palace Group has bought its Southern African infrastructure and building businesses for R314m, creating the first large black-owned infrastructure business in SA, according to Murray &amp; Roberts CEO Henry Laas.Meanwhile, Germany&rsquo;s ATM Holding has acquired 25.5% of Murray &amp; Roberts&rsquo; shares on the JSE, making it the major shareholder. This comes as the group reported a more than 70% fall in its interim diluted continuing headline EPS (HEPS) for the six months to December.Including the upfront payment of R170m relating to the voluntary settlement with government, Murray &amp; Roberts is reporting an attributable loss of R60m &mdash; a steep reversal from a R376m profit in the same period in 2015.ATM is a subsidiary of Aton, a private German investment holding company with stakes in mining and engineering activities. Aton discussed a potential merger with the mining operations of Murray &amp; Roberts between September 2015 and April 2016, but nothing came of the talks. By buying such a large stake, Aton is now fuelling speculation of a possible hostile takeover bid.WBHO chairman Mike Wylie says it is &ldquo;absolutely clear&rdquo; the industry needs to become more inclusive. But he also says the collective fine of R1.46bn imposed on 15 construction and engineering groups by the competition commission &ldquo;pushed us along these lines&rdquo;.WBHO reported interims to December 2016 this week, and says HEPS have been significantly dented on account of the one-off settlement amount.Aveng has reported that revenues plunged 21% to R14.3bn in the six months to December from the same period in 2015. It had an adjusted headline loss of R76m in the period compared with a headline loss of R231m for the comparative half-year. This includes R165m it has paid in terms of the voluntary settlement agreement.Meanwhile, Group Five&rsquo;s core operating profit plunged from a R315m profit to a loss of R338m in the six months ended December. This was due to a liability of R153m arising from the settlement agreement.The group also announced that CEO Eric Vemer will be leaving the company in the next few weeks, saying only that it is looking for a suitable replacement.Mish-al Emeran, an equity analyst at Electus Fund Managers, says Vemer&rsquo;s departure comes as a surprise. &ldquo;At the results presentation [Vemer] simply stated that he wants to pursue other opportunities,&rdquo; Emeran says.Aveng, meanwhile, has effectively sold a 51% interest in Aveng Grinaker-LTA, part of its Aveng Africa subsidiary, to Kutana Construction, which is owned by black women.WBHO will mentor three emerging contractors to enable them to acquire the volume of work needed to generate a combined annual turnover of at least 25% of its yearly SA civil engineering and building revenue within seven years.
