Finance minister Pravin Gordhan will surely have done enough to appease the ratings agencies for a few more months at least, having delivered a budget that sucked more out the country&rsquo;s workforce without appearing to break anyone.Economically, it was solid &mdash; if often unpalatable. For example, Gordhan found a way to raise another R28bn in ever-more creative ways &mdash; principally, through the introduction of an entirely new tax bracket for those earning more than R1.5m/year.There are only 103,000 South Africans in this category, but they&rsquo;ll now have to pay 45% tax, an increase from the 41% that applies to anyone earning more than R700,000/year.But, then, Gordhan had to think creatively: the SA Revenue Service&rsquo;s (Sars) tax collection was an immense R30.4bn lower than estimated.Sars&rsquo; problems are partly because of anaemic growth, but also because of chaos inside the revenue service itself &mdash; it is racked by infighting, with Sars commissioner Tom Moyane at war with his own boss, Gordhan. (It was notable that Gordhan didn&rsquo;t mention Moyane once, let alone thank him.)Speaking to journalists before the budget, Gordhan could have been speaking about Sars when he said: &ldquo;One of the things about institutions is that it can take many years to build a solid institution. It takes a very short time to mess it up.&rdquo;During his speech, he spoke of other efforts to raise money too, including hiking dividend withholding tax from 15% to 20% (raising another R6.8bn) and a 39c/l hike in the fuel price (bringing in R3.2bn)Much of it was uncontroversial: he chose not to do a few others things that some analysts had speculated about. For example, he opted not to hike Vat by an extra two percentage points. Such a move would have brought in lots more money, but would also have hit the poor hardest.Perhaps most commendably, Gordhan held the line by not mentioning any new money allocated to the nuclear programme &mdash; one of President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s pet projects.This is why the rand hardly reacted, moving marginally lower from R13.08/US$ to about R13.16. If this could be described as weakness, it was a response to Gordhan&rsquo;s low expectation for growth, which he said would hit just 1.3% next year.What will give the credit agencies some cheer is that Gordhan vowed to trim the budget deficit to 2.6% of GDP by March 2020, from the 3.1% of this year.However, if you look at Gordhan&rsquo;s budget from a political perspective, it was a masterstroke.Coming into his speech, he was facing perhaps the most hostile context yet for an SA finance minister.Two weeks ago, water minister Nomvula Mokonyane called for treasury&rsquo;s wings to be clipped so everyone could share the &ldquo;cake&rdquo;.&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be correct that treasury [tells us] what can happen and what cannot happen,&rdquo; she said.Others in cabinet, many of whom have patchy records themselves, agree with Mokonyane &mdash; including mining minister Mosebenzi Zwane &mdash; and their clarion call has taken the form of demanding &ldquo;radical economic transformation&rdquo;.Quite where Mokonyane thinks Gordhan can get money from isn&rsquo;t exactly clear. This is because the truly alarming number is that of government debt, which now stands at an immense R2.2trillion and is threatening to run away with us. Just to service the debt on that costs R169bn every year.Nonetheless, Gordhan embraced the notion of &ldquo;radical economic transformation&rdquo;, then successfully reframed it by defining what it should be. This gave substance to a phrase that had remained worryingly vague when uttered by Zuma during his state of the nation address two weeks ago, seemingly more a tool of rhetoric than policy.In all, Gordhan used the word &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; 54 times in his speech &mdash; more, even, than the 50 times he mentioned &ldquo;growth&rdquo;.&ldquo;We need to transform in order to grow, we need to grow in order to transform. Without transformation, growth will reinforce inequality; without growth, transformation will be distorted by patronage,&rdquo; he said.Wealth is still allocated along lines that are &ldquo;fundamentally unjust&rdquo;, he said.Addressing the sentiment expressed by Mokonyane, Gordhan said the budget was actually &ldquo;highly redistributive to poor and working families&rdquo;, as it takes resources from urban economies to fund services in rural areas.&ldquo;About two-thirds of the budget is dedicated to realising social rights,&rdquo; he said. This includes funding the building of homes and schools, education for children and grants for the most vulnerable.To actually make this happen, he has set aside more money for spending on education and infrastructure a slow-burn path to growth and transformation that surely won t appease the plutocrats, as it doesn t involve an asset grab .After the speech, it took EFF leader Julius Malema to point out that while all the opposition MPs stood up, united, to cheer Gordhan when he entered parliament, some on his side weren t standing up .Malema called the budget workable in an interview with television channel eNCA, as Gordhan had done well to cater for the poor, given the constraints. Gordhan is able to stand-up to the wrong things; he is able to stand up to rot, he said. He calls a spade a spade. IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, too, called the budget magnificent , while Business Leadership SA s Jabu Mabuza said Gordhan had done a great job in containing spending.Unlike a few weeks back, when Zuma spoke in parliament, the only interruption to the speech came from the EFF, when Gordhan thanked his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, for his absolute integrity . This sparked a loud and prolonged round of applause from the opposition benches presumably as it was Jonas who took on the Gupta family for offering him a job.The respect for Gordhan was almost tangible perhaps a reflection of the hope that this won t be his last budget.
