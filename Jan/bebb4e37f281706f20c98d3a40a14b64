If you re looking to find real "hate speech", you probably won t find it on The Huffington Post. The website s editor, Verashni Pillay, resigned on Saturday after the press ombudsman found that an opinion column carried by the Post, arguing that white men should be disenfranchised, amounted to "hate speech".There s no sugarcoating that it was a disaster. Pillay s team published the blog post by an academic called Shelley Garland, which, it turns out, was a pseudonym for a white man named Marius Roodt. The facts in the story were wrong; the argument objectionable. But Roodt had written it to make the (rather obvious) point that fact-checking is scant in the modern SA media environment.But hate speech? Media lawyer Dario Milo certainly doesn t think so, as it doesn t "incite people to cause harm".If you re really looking for hate speech, you might want to check out the platform that became a toxic echo chamber for those people demanding that Pillay resign: Twitter. The social media platform is a cesspit of anger, vitriol and unbridled animosity. Abuse and incorrect facts are the order of the day. Bristling with bullying and narcissism, Twitter is a digital manifestation of the worst of humanity.If anyone should be held accountable for inciting hatred based on false facts, it s that platform and its users.
