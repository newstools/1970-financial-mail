The great clean-out at the SABC proceeds apace. Hot on the heels of its move to suspend acting CEO James Aguma and to discipline ex-COO and chief wrecker Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the corporation s interim board under chair Khanyisile Kweyama, is poised to scrap a number of dodgy deals entered into by the "captured" public broadcaster including a highly unusual if not illegal contract to air a business breakfast show produced by a Gupta-owned television entity.Never mind that there have been two no-confidence motions against Jacob Zuma in the ANC s NEC, or that a new poll has found 62% of ANC supporters want the president out, it seems there s no end to David Des van Rooyen s toadying to JZ.
