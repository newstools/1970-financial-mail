In 1997 my partner and I began buying antiretrovirals to save his life. At that time, the cost was about R6,000/month and there was no assistance from medical aid. Fortunately, he was a chemical engineer and I was a chartered accountant.We now pay in the region of R400/month and his health is fine.Aspen was absolutely instrumental in bringing down the cost of the medication.I am no expert when it comes to medication or politics, but I have always felt that when it comes to all things South African, Europe seems to have a chip on its shoulder!I am aware that this is just my opinion, but your recent article on Aspen made me think that perhaps there could be some truth to this.Hilton Davis via e-mail
