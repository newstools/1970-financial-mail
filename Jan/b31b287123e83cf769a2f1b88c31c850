If the cold front that froze SA in the past week had you fearing that spring was still a long way off, the people from the Steenberg wine estate are pretty certain that it s not.In anticipation, the estate has released the new Steenberg Ruby Ros , which picked up double gold at Ros Rocks 2017, SA s only ros wine competition.Steenberg s vintners say this dry, light wine has all the delights of spring and summer, brought on by the whiffs of watermelon sorbet, toffee apple and red licorice candy. Adding to the depth is a citrus finish with hints of raspberries and wild strawberries.It is perfect for picnics, light lunches and sundowners. Just having a few bottles chilling in the fridge should help you over the cold dip as the days draw closer to warmer times.
