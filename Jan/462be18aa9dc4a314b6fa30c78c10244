Remember the hype over Homo Naledi, an apparently new species in the bipedal family tree, back in 2015?On that occasion, journalists were summoned to Maropeng, where they were shown bones found at the bottom of a cave. Their significance appeared to be that they showed evidence of advanced cultural practices such as burial.National Geographic went berserk with a cover story under the banner &quot;Almost Human&quot; and page upon page of speculative illustration of how these ancestors had lived their lives.The nation swooned, but the scientific community was not impressed. Palaeoanthropology professor Tim White said: &quot;It is clear to see why [science journal] Nature rejected the many manuscripts submitted to [it], and post hoc explanation that this was because the papers were not compatible with Nature&#8217;s format is obfuscation of the fact that they failed to pass rigorous peer review.&quot;The newly described &#8216;species&#8217; is an example of artificial species inflation in palaeoanthropology.&quot;One of the things that Prof Lee Berger was vague about was the dating of the bones, but an estimate of about 2m years was given.This week that was revised to 200,000 or 300,000 years &#8212; which means the find is not nearly as interesting as it was hyped to be.As journalist Paige Williams put it in the New Yorker last year: &quot;All early human remains are scientifically valuable, but those dated in the vicinity of 2m years old are especially prized, because they fall near a key point in the fossil record: the origin of Homo.&quot;There isn&#8217;t a palaeoanthropologist alive who wouldn&#8217;t like to clarify what happened in the million-year evidentiary gap between the small-brained, long-armed australopithecines and our own, big-brained genus.&quot;For now, that palaeoanthropologist is not Berger.
